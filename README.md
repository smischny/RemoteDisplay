# RemoteDisplay

This library looks like a local display (TFT), but instead will send the messages to a remote system for display.   This was originally written to send messages between two devices using NRF24L01 modules.   But the transport layer can be anything where a session can be esstablished between two systems.


## Dependancies:

None

## Security
Security, if needed, must be implemented in the Transport layer.
